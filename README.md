# Sentiment-Analysis
I recently completed a project focused on sentiment analysis of social media data using machine learning techniques. The goal was to create a model that accurately classifies the sentiment of tweets as positive, negative, or neutral.



Key Highlights:

Models Used: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

Results:

Naive Bayes:

Accuracy: 0.71

F1-Score: 0.48

SVM:

Accuracy: 0.80

F1-Score: 0.72

LSTM:

Accuracy: 0.79

F1-Score: 0.73

Tools and Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Keras, and Matplotlib

What I Learned:

The importance of text preprocessing, including tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.

How to effectively evaluate model performance using various metrics.

Gained hands-on experience with deep learning workflows.

Outcomes and Conclusions:

The SVM model outperformed the other two models, achieving the highest accuracy and F1-score.

The LSTM model came close, with a slightly lower accuracy and F1-score.

The Naive Bayes model performed the worst, with a lower accuracy and F1-score.
